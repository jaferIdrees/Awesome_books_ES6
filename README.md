# Awesome Book App - ES6 Modules

- Created a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
- Created a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
- Created a function to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the array filter() method).
- All books are saved in the collection in the top part of the page.
- When a user clicks the "Add" button: A new book is added to the collection.
- The new book is displayed in the page.
- When a user clicks the "Remove" button: The correct book is removed from the collection.
- The correct book dissapears from the page.
- The data is preserved in the browser's memory by using localStorage.
- A Navigation bar is added with Three sections:Books list, Add book form and  Contact info.
- When user  click on any of the links, the main area changes to display only one of the three content sections
- Refactor JS code to use ES6 modules
